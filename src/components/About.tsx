                            I have about 7 years of programming experience and have remained passionate about software design, usability, and maintainability. 
                            These are all things that I strive to get better at each and every day.

                            When it comes to designing something new, writing code, writing tests, etc... I am very detail oriented and documentation heavy.
                            I like to think of myself as a "Digital Craftsman" as <a className="underline" href="https://jacobleech.com/">this developer</a> puts it.

                            Outside of the world of engineering, I like to travel, hike, jog etc... I like to stay active since most of my hours are spent at my home office. 
                            I'm also a bit of a PC and car enthusiast as well!
